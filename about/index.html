<p>When it comes to the Turkic Nation, it is necessary to answer questions about the ethnographic teachings of the Turks in the VI-XII centuries, such as the system of life, customs and traditions. Without it, we would be unaware of the ethnographic realities of those times. Thus, ancient Turkic ethnography is a branch of Kazakh ethnography that, due to its ancestral, proto-Turkic nature, should be considered diachronically in the space of ethnic groups of general Turkic origin, and thus the study of ancient Kazakh ancestral traditions, in other words, historical ethnography.</p>

<p>Turkology as a systematic science in the era of the Russian Empire was developed by the famous Turkologist V.V. Although it is known that it was formed by Radlov, the study of the nature of the ancient Turkic ethnic groups belongs to the ancient Chinese historians and travelers. Because about the same epochs Slavic, Persian, Arabic, Greek, Byzantine, Indian and others. Chinese chronicles and historical notions have given us more information than the facts. These are in the category of data in foreign languages, and archeological, etc., preserved from the era of the Turkic Nation.</p>

<p>Archaeological finds typical of the Turks are abundant and are being excavated. However, it is too early to say that we are fully aware of the unified ethnographic appearance of the Turkic Era, having reviewed the archeological materials identified so far. Of course, it is illogical to say that all the everyday ethnographic artifacts of the Turks are found, and it is not enough to fully determine their customs and traditions as a result of archeological excavations.</p>

<p>In general, there is a tendency to interpret the ancient Turkic epoch in chronological, ethnocultural, ethno-political terms (DG Savinov). So far, the basic research work of archeological excavations, of course, includes a collective work entitled “The Eurasian steppes in the Middle Ages” (“The steppes of Eurasia in the Middle Ages”). Here Archaeological excavations in Central Asia, Siberia, Eastern Europe, Volga and the North Caucasus in the IV-XIV centuries have been completed. Unfortunately, this work does not take into account the archeological excavations in the Orkhon, Selenga, Tuul river valleys, the center of the Turkic world, the black shanyrak, i.e. the territory of modern Mongolia, as well as in Ordos (Inner Mongolia), China and East Turkestan.</p>
